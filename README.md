# Path Finding Algorithm in a 2D grid
## Usage:
There are two modes to select from:`"Phase1"` and `"Phase2"`:

Example:
```
❯ python3 pathfindingAlg.py "Phase1"
selected mode: Phase1
Path: [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6), (7, 7), (8, 8), (9, 9)]
Number of Steps: 9
```

```
❯ python3 pathfindingAlg.py "Phase2"
selected mode: Phase2
Path: [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 8), (9, 9)]
Number of Steps: 18
```
